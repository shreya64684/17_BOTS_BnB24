<body>
  <h1>Book Your Appointment Easily with SMS!</h1>
  <p>You can now schedule appointments directly from your phone through SMS messaging.</p>

  <h2>Here's how it works:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Open your messaging app and send a new SMS message to **[Your Twilio phone number]**.</li>
    <li>In the message body, type the following:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keyword:</strong> Start your message with the keyword **[Your booking keyword]** (e.g., BOOK).</li>
        <li><strong>Date and Time:</strong> After the keyword, add the desired date and time of your appointment in **YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format** (e.g., 2024-02-23 15:00).</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Example message: <strong>BOOK 2024-02-23 15:00</strong></li>
    <li>Send the message. You will receive a confirmation SMS once your appointment is booked.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Important Notes:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Please use the exact format for date and time.</li>
    <li>Currently, you can only book one appointment at a time via SMS.</li>
    <li>For any questions or assistance, please call us at [Phone number] or visit our website.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We are still under development, but we are excited to offer this convenient way to book appointments!</p>
